  <h1>What is backend? </h1>

  <div class="definition">
    <p>backend <i>(noun):</i> the part of a software system that is not visible or accessible to the user. May also be as written back end <i>(noun) </i>or back-end <i>(adjective).</i></p>
  </div>

  <!-- explain the definition of backend with ~100 words-->
  <p>Frontend and backend are terms used to describe the layers that make up software based on how accessible the layers are to a user. Backend is the layer that “does the real work” without being seen nor accessed directly by the end user. </p>

  <p><mark>Backend development is what keeps things running behind the scenes.</mark></p>

  <p>Backend development refers to the server-side development and consists of databases, scripting, and website architecture. Software developers that work with backend write code that focuses on the functionality and logic powering the application they’re working on; the technology they work on is never directly seen by users.</p>
